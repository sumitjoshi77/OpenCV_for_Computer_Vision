# OpenCV_for_Computer_Vision
OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library used for image and video analysis. This tutorial covers some basic OpenCV functionality like:
Image, video, and webcam reading - Loading images, videos, and accessing webcam feeds
Resizing and cropping - Modifying image sizes and cropping regions of interest
Color space conversions - Converting between color representations like RGB, grayscale, HSV

Image filters - Blurring, smoothing, and reducing noise
Thresholding - Binarizing images based on pixel intensity
Edge detection - Finding edges using filters like Sobel, Laplace, Canny
Drawing - Adding overlays like lines, rectangles, text
Contour detection - Outlining shapes and objects

Computer vision with OpenCV enables automated analysis and understanding of visual data. Some applications include:
Image classification - Labeling image content
Object detection - Localizing objects like faces
Image segmentation - Grouping pixels by regions
Feature extraction - Identifying interest points
